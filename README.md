# Blender-Workshop-Shading

Welcome on this new Blender Workshop !
We are going to discover procedural textures generations.

This workshop is intended for Blender 3.5.x. Download it [here](https://www.blender.org)

As you I said during the live modeling session, there is plenty of ways to create textures in Blender. I choosed to cover procedural texture generation, because it's closer to computer programming than other methods.
Also, it enables us to create infinites textures (a thing that images textures can't do, because images are limited !)

This workshop will take on a whole new form compared to others you've done, because all the steps will not be described in the README.md but directly and interactively in the software !

## Let's start.
Download the .blend file of this workshop and open it with Blender 3.5 (click on it, or launch Blender then file > open...)
You should spawn on a screen like this one :

On the top of the image (red rectangle), you can see many tabs. Each tab is a step. You can hover over it with your mouse and scroll to see all of them.
On the left part of the screen (green), you can see text, it's the step instructions.
At the bottom right (magenta), you can see the Node Editor, where we are going to create our textures.
At the top right (cyan), where you can see a big cube and a big sphere, is the viewport, where you can *see* your textures.

Note that now you see only gray. This is because your are in Solid View, used to model things. But we want to textures things !
For this, at the top right of the viewport (yellow rectangle), you can see 4 tiny spheres. Select the one at the middle right and you should see something more like this :

**Don't forget that you will need to do it for each tab.**
On each tab, the text will start by :
Viewport: Material Preview/Rendered
If you see "Material Preview", switch to this mode :

If you see "Rendered" swith to this mode :

This is because Material Preview is faster (useful because we will all be on laptop for this workshop), but less accurate that rendered view (no shadows by example). So sometimes we will need to use Rendered view despite it performance impact (but don't be worried, it's not like night and day, it's a small but noticeable impact)

So, now that you're all set, it's up to you ! Read carefully the instructions of each steps and start to create your own textures !
Don't skip steps !
