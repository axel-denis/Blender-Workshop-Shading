# Blender-Workshop-Shading

Welcome on this new Blender Workshop !
We are going to discover procedural textures generations.

This workshop is intended for Blender 3.5.x. Download it [here](blender.org)

As you I said during the live modeling session, there is plenty of ways to create textures in Blender. I choosed to cover procedural texture generation, because it's closer to computer programming than other methods.
